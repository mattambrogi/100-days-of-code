### Day 10: Tuesday February 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Contined on blog app in chapter 5 of Django for beginners. Added individual pages for blog posts, the ability to create a post via a from, the ability to edit a post via a form, some initial tests. Up next is ability to delete, user authentication, and more tests.

**Key Learning**: Learning about how models can both populate and be fed my forms. A little about absolute urls to direct users. How primary keys work in detail views. 

**Thoughts:** Fun to make a lot of progress. Excited to do more. I do feel like I should take more time to understand structure and theory. For example, could barely explain any of the above. But, for now I think it makes sense to focus on just building, as the patterns will begin to come together for me. May make sense to block of a day for concept review and reading (maybe Sundays.)

### Day 9: Tuesday February 09, 2021

**Today's Progress**: No progress, mental health day.

### Day 8: Monday February 08, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Began Blog app, chapter 5 of Django for Beginners. Configured DB, set up urls, views, and templates for home page which displays posts from DB. Added in some html and css. 

**Key Learning**: Getting down the pattern of create a model, set up urls for view, which displays template. Starting to see how Django scripting can display DB info in template. Learned about foreign keys and many-to-one relationships (i.e. many blog posts to one author).

**Thoughts:** Felt good. Can see a lot of applications for the underlying pattern: allow user to create db entry. Then display those. Job board, stores, etc. 

**Minutes Worked:** 68

### Day 7: Sunday February 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built, tested, and deployed my first database driven app. Chapter 4 of Django for Beginners. An extremely basic message board.

**Key Learning**: Creating a database model, updating it with the admin panel, and displaying contents from the database on a webpage. 

**Thoughts:** Very cool. Once I get the basics of creating databases and displaying their contents, that opens up a whole new world for me and a lot I can build. I understand how to use that and how to work with databases already. No-code, bubble experience actually very helpful here. Know what pulling db info to populate content is like.

**Minutes Worked:** 103

### Day 2: Tuesday, February 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed chapter 2 of Django for Beginners. Set up a Django website that displayed "Hello World"

**Thoughts:** 30 minutes into working, ran into a bug which would not allow me to start my server. After an hour, I realized that VS Code had automatically put a file into UTF-16, as opposed to UTF-8. Fixed that and everything worked.

### (Example )

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
