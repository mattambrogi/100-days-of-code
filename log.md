### Day 2: Tuesday, February 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed chapter 2 of Django for Beginners. Set up a Django website that displayed "Hello World"

**Thoughts:** 30 minutes into working, ran into a bug which would not allow me to start my server. After an hour, I realized that VS Code had automatically put a file into UTF-16, as opposed to UTF-8. Fixed that and everything worked.

**Minutes Worked:** 105

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
