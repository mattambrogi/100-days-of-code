# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 01, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Forked this repo, reinstalled Python, updated VS Code, installed pipenv and Django

**Thoughts:** Ran into an issue in which I had to add directory where pipenv was to PATH. Fixed it.

### (Example )

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

1. [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
