### Day 18: Thursday February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued setup of Newspaper app. Added password change and password reset capabilities.  

**Key Learning**: How much Django offers out of the box.

**Thoughts:** Django is phenomenal here. Basically everything exists out of the box. Just a matter of customizing templates.

**Minutes Worked:** 41

### Day 17: Wednesday February 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued setup of Newspaper app. Added views and urls for pages. Created seperate pages app. Added tests. Added bootstrap and crispy forms. Next up: change password, then emai, then actual app. 

**Key Learning**: Solidying url/view/template process. Seeing how to further break up project with pages app. One useful thing: if there's bootstrap magic you want to change, easiest to go to source code in github and search in search bar. There you can get an understanding of what you need to do. 

**Thoughts:** Nice to see things looking decent with Bootstrap :). Took some time to understand tests. 

**Minutes Worked:** 75

### Day 16: Tuesday February 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Began last project of Django for Beginners - Newspaper App. Built user model and created templates for base, home, login, signup

**Key Learning**: Solidying process for starting up a new project. Directories, installing django, creating project and first apps, setting up user model, creating inital templates, views, urls.

**Thoughts:** Very tired tonight. Feeling sloppy. Will come back ready to add in views and urls for first templates tomorrow.

**Minutes Worked:** 60

### Day 15: Monday February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added Heroku config and deployed blog app, concluding the first major project of Learn Django for Beginners.

**Key Learning**: Some notes on staticfiles and the steps required for deployment. 

**Thoughts:** I should read up more to understand static files. I should also put together a check list for each: 1. creating a project 2. creating each new view, template, url combo 3. deployment

**Minutes Worked:** 30

### Day 14: Sunday February 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: None. On vacation.


### Day 13: Saturday February 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: None. On vacation.


### Day 10: Friday February 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished chapter 7 and blog app from Django for Beginners. Added ability to delete posts. Added user accounts, log in, log out, and sign up. 

**Key Learning**: The basics of user models.

**Thoughts:** Super exciting to finish this first project. So cool how easy it was to implement user accounts. If I was to work on this more, I would display the author next to each post, move the log in / log out for improved UI, and add controls so that users can only edit their own posts. For now, I'm just going to keep cranking on to the last project of this book because I think it will cover a lot of that. 

**Minutes Worked:** 60




### Day 11: Thursday February 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: None. Preparing for weekend trip.


### Day 10: Wednesday February 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Contined on blog app in chapter 5 of Django for beginners. Added individual pages for blog posts, the ability to create a post via a from, the ability to edit a post via a form, some initial tests. Up next is ability to delete, user authentication, and more tests.

**Key Learning**: Learning about how models can both populate and be fed my forms. A little about absolute urls to direct users. How primary keys work in detail views. 

**Thoughts:** Fun to make a lot of progress. Excited to do more. I do feel like I should take more time to understand structure and theory. For example, could barely explain any of the above. But, for now I think it makes sense to focus on just building, as the patterns will begin to come together for me. May make sense to block of a day for concept review and reading (maybe Sundays.)

### Day 9: Tuesday February 09, 2021

**Today's Progress**: No progress, mental health day.

### Day 8: Monday February 08, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Began Blog app, chapter 5 of Django for Beginners. Configured DB, set up urls, views, and templates for home page which displays posts from DB. Added in some html and css. 

**Key Learning**: Getting down the pattern of create a model, set up urls for view, which displays template. Starting to see how Django scripting can display DB info in template. Learned about foreign keys and many-to-one relationships (i.e. many blog posts to one author).

**Thoughts:** Felt good. Can see a lot of applications for the underlying pattern: allow user to create db entry. Then display those. Job board, stores, etc.

### Day 7: Sunday February 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Built, tested, and deployed my first database driven app. Chapter 4 of Django for Beginners. An extremely basic message board.

**Key Learning**: Creating a database model, updating it with the admin panel, and displaying contents from the database on a webpage. 

**Thoughts:** Very cool. Once I get the basics of creating databases and displaying their contents, that opens up a whole new world for me and a lot I can build. I understand how to use that and how to work with databases already. No-code, bubble experience actually very helpful here. Know what pulling db info to populate content is like.

### Day 2: Tuesday, February 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed chapter 2 of Django for Beginners. Set up a Django website that displayed "Hello World"

**Thoughts:** 30 minutes into working, ran into a bug which would not allow me to start my server. After an hour, I realized that VS Code had automatically put a file into UTF-16, as opposed to UTF-8. Fixed that and everything worked.
